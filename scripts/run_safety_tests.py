# Checks that dangerous or broken student code only fails its own tests and never crashes or hangs the grading.
# It talks to Judge0 directly (judge0_client.run_tests, the same call the grader makes, with the same limits and
# the same 11 s time slice), so it does not use any Gemini quota.
# For every case it prints the status Judge0 gave each test, how long it took, and PASS or FAIL.
#   PASS = the call returned normally, in time, and every test has the expected outcome
#   FAIL = Judge0Error (the whole call failed or ran out of time) or an unexpected status
# Needs Judge0 running. Run it from the project root: python scripts/run_safety_tests.py
