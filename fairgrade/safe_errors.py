# Turns an exception into a short text that is safe to log and to return in the result's "error" field.
# Error messages can contain the data that caused them (pydantic prints the input value, a library may quote
# the reply), and here that data is the student's answer or the model's reply, which must never reach a log.
# So only these parts are used:
#   - validation errors: where the problem is and its message, never the input value
#   - Gemini api errors: the http code and status (the message too for 400 and 404, which are about our request)
#   - errors raised by this project (ValueError and TimeoutError from our own checks, Judge0Error, GradingError): their message,
#     which is written without any model or student text
#   - anything else: only the name of the error
